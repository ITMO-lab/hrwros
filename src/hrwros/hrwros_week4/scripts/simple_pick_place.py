## To use the python interface to move_group, import the moveit_commander
## module.  We also import rospy and some messages that we will use.
import sys
import copy
import rospy
import moveit_commander
import moveit_msgs.msg
import actionlib
import geometry_msgs

def simple_pick_place():
  ## First initialize moveit_commander and rospy.
  moveit_commander.roscpp_initialize(sys.argv)
  rospy.init_node('simple_pick_place',
                  anonymous=True)

  ## Instantiate a MoveGroupCommander object.  This object is an interface
  ## to one group of joints.  In this case the group refers to the joints of
  ## robot1. This interface can be used to plan and execute motions on robot1.
  robot1_group = moveit_commander.MoveGroupCommander("robot1")
  ## MoveGroup Commander Object for robot2.
  robot2_group = moveit_commander.MoveGroupCommander("robot2")

  ## Action clients to the ExecuteTrajectory action server.
  robot1_client = actionlib.SimpleActionClient('execute_trajectory',
    moveit_msgs.msg.ExecuteTrajectoryAction)
  robot1_client.wait_for_server()
  rospy.loginfo('Execute Trajectory server is available for robot1')

    moveit_msgs.msg.ExecuteTrajectoryAction)
  robot2_client.wait_for_server()
  rospy.loginfo('Execute Trajectory server is available for robot2')

  ## Set a named joint configuration as the goal to plan for a move group.
  ## Named joint configurations are the robot poses defined via MoveIt! Setup Assistant.

  ## Cartesian Paths
  ## ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ## You can plan a cartesian path directly by specifying a list of waypoints
  ## for the end-effector to go through.

  new_eef_pose = geometry_msgs.msg.Pose()

  # Manual offsets because we don't have a camera to detect objects yet.
  new_eef_pose.position.x = current_pose.pose.position.x + 0.10
  new_eef_pose.position.y = current_pose.pose.position.y - 0.20
  new_eef_pose.position.z = current_pose.pose.position.z - 0.20

  # Retain orientation of the current pose.
  new_eef_pose.orientation = copy.deepcopy(current_pose.pose.orientation)

  waypoints.append(new_eef_pose)
  waypoints.append(current_pose.pose)
  print(new_eef_pose.position)
  print(current_pose.pose.position)

  ## We want the cartesian path to be interpolated at a resolution of 1 cm
  ## which is why we will specify 0.01 as the eef_step in cartesian
  ## translation.  We will specify the jump threshold as 0.0, effectively
  ## disabling it.
